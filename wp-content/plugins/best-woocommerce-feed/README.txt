== Why Use WooCommerce Product Feed Manager? ==
With an easy user interface, you can get exclusive features:

**Auto-sync with Google Shopping**
You can auto-sync your store products with Google Merchant Shop. You can set it up so that your generated product feed will automatically be updated and sent to your Google Merchant Shop as per your schedule. You do not need to download and upload feed for Google Shopping Center manually.

**Category Mapping**
Google requires you to set your products under their fixed Category Lists. But changing your own store's categories is not necessary. You can use the category mapping feature to map your store categories according to Google's. So your store's categories will still be the same while your products will be placed under the relevant Google category on the product feed. You can use it to map categories for other sites as well (i.e., it is not limited to Google).

> *Not only does it supports 1-to-1 category mapping but you can also map subsets of products on a merchant-category based on product names.*

**Extensive Filter Options**
You can use the smooth filter options to include or exclude the required products of your store to the product feed. You can filter by categories, tags, or apply custom filters using other attributes.

**Schedule Auto Update Of the Product Feed**
Any changes you make to product data, you can set a schedule for your product feed to be updated automatically. You do not need to manually update the product feed every time you make changes to your products.

**Advanced Custom Fields**
WooCommerce doesn't provide certain fields such as Brand, GTIN, UPC, Age-group, Gender, etc. Many merchant shops require these data. Hence, WooCommerce Product Feed Manager creates these custom fields for you so that you can generate accurate product feed without any extra coding or plugins.

You will have many more features to help you generate product feed at ease.

You should use this plugin because it will save you time and create clean quality product feed to promote through other merchant shopping channels.

>  You will get a **reliable support team** to help you out at all times and detailed [documentation](https://rextheme.com/docs/WooCommerce-product-feed/) and [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYRgnMFQGH8&list=PLelDqLncNWcVoPA7T4eyyfzTF0i_Scbnq).

**Google Analytics Support**
You can add and configure Google Analytics UTM tracking-codes to your product URLs. It will allow you to measure the effectiveness of marketing channels in Google Analytics.


**Track Products With Facebook Pixel**
You can now add Facebook pixel code to your store and track the performance for every product you upload on Facebook dynamic shop using this plugin.

You can track:
- Simple product pages
- Variable product and variations pages
- Category pages
- Search result pages
- Cart page
- Add to cart button
- Thank you page


== Other Advantages ==

The plugin is compatible with any themes and can handle any number of products. It uses batch processing, which ensures all your products will be included in the feed without slowing down your site in a matter of seconds.

Generate feed in supported file formats by the merchants such as XML, CSV, or Text.

Also, add your own dynamic attributes or custom taxonomy where required.
